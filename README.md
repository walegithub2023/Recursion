# NAME OF REPOSITORY: Recursion



# DESCRIPTION: A repository for Checkpoint Recursion. This repo holds an algorithm which is described below.



# An alorithm to test if a word is a palindrome. A word is a palindrome if only if it can be read from left to right or from right to left: gag; kayak; php; radar;....:


# Below is a discription of what the alorithm is doing(algorithm steps to solve the problem):


# Naming the algorithm.

            ALGORITHM recursion

# Begin the recursion algorithm

# Function to count the length of a word

    FUNCTION countCharacters(VAR word:STRING[] ) : INTEGER

# Function to trim a word by removing the first and last characters

    FUNCTION trimWord(word:STRING ) : STRING

# Function to check Palindrome

    FUNCTION check_palindrome(word: STRING) : STRING

# End the recursion algorithm.
